# JWST_NIRISS_AMI_Project
Project for space instrumentation, conducting 1st order analysis using the AMI instrument on JWST. This is creating a renormed standard deviation of closure phase and comparing it to a SG FWHM. This work is inspired by: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad21fb/pdf

# Functions
There are 7 functions used in this code. All have been made into their own file for readability.

# Main File
The main file is the entire script without the functions in them. There is some redundency due to troubleshooting during the debugging phase, if needed comment those lines out.
